**Predicting mortality of heart failure patients** 
- Developed a machine learning model to predict mortality in heart failure patients using a Kaggle dataset, applying data preprocessing with pandas for one-hot encoding and Scikit-Learn for feature scaling.
- Built and trained a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify patient survival, evaluating its accuracy with classification reports.
